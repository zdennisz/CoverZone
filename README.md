Lets imagine this secenario, you are in charge of building the best  defence system known to mankind.</br>
But alas you need to know where to place the cameras to know if the grounds are covered!!!</br>
This is where the app comes into play.</br>
At first you can enter the camera info and see which area it will cover next step you will be able to place the cameras via settalite view </br>
and see the dounoughts of coverage watching :)</br>

The app is built under the `MVVM` architecture and written in `kotlin` language  and the layouts are `data/view binded`</br>
The data is saved in a local database via `ROOM` by using `coroutines` </br>
