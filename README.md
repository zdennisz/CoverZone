:sunglasses:
Lets imagine this secenario, you are in charge of building the best  defence system known to mankind.

But alas you need to know where to place the cameras to know if the grounds are covered!!!

This is where the app comes into play.

At first you can enter the camera info and see which area it will cover next step you will be able to place the cameras via settalite view and see the :doughnut: dounoughts of coverage watching ðŸ˜Š

The app is built under the `MVVM` architecture and written in `kotlin` language  and the layouts are `data/view binded`</br>
The data is saved in a local database via `ROOM` by using `coroutines` </br>
